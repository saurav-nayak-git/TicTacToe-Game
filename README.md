Extra evaluation points: 
• Analyze the kata with an agile approach: product backlog, epics and smaller user story with UAT for the TDD approach; • Create the UAT compliant with a BDD framework; 
• Publish the project into an open source repository; 
• Create the CI and CD pipeline; 
• Publish the code coverage; 
• Delivery the project with a Docker application container; 
• Design the project with a modern CQRS one page application architecture;
